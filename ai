Azure KPI Thresholds – Senior SRE (12+ Years) Recommendations

This document lists clear, actionable changes you can apply directly to the Excel workbook. It is structured so you can update the sheets without ambiguity.

1. Global Changes (Apply to ALL Sheets)

1.1 Add a New Column: Alert Type

Column name: Alert Type

Allowed values (standardized):

Incident

Capacity

Signal

Definition:

Incident – User-impacting, requires immediate response (P1/P2)

Capacity – Risk indicator, requires scaling or planned action

Signal – Informational, trend or diagnostic only

1.2 (Optional but Recommended) Add Ownership Column

Column name: Resolver Group / Service Owner

Purpose:

Reduces MTTR

Prevents ticket bouncing

Enables ServiceNow auto-routing

1.3 (Optional) Add Automation Readiness Column

Column name: Automation Ready

Values:

Yes – Safe for OO / auto-remediation

No – Human decision required

2. SQL_DB Sheet Recommendations

Incident Alerts (Keep as-is, add Alert Type)

Set Alert Type = Incident for:

Availability %

Connection Failed

Deadlock Count

Failed Connections (System/User)

Blocked by Firewall

CPU / DTU / DWU Limit Exceeded

Capacity Alerts

Set Alert Type = Capacity for:

CPU Percentage

DTU Consumption %

Log IO Percentage

Data IO Percentage

Storage Used %

Enhancement to threshold text:
Add:

"OR deviation >30% from 7-day baseline"

Signal Alerts

Set Alert Type = Signal for:

Sessions Count

Reason:

Useful for diagnosing overload vs underutilization

Not a user-impacting signal by itself

3. SQL_MI Sheet Recommendations

Incident Alerts

Set Alert Type = Incident for:

Availability-related request failures

Capacity Alerts

Set Alert Type = Capacity for:

CPU Usage %

IO Bytes Read

IO Bytes Written

Storage Space Used

Threshold enhancement:

Ensure all are sustained for 10–15 minutes

Add New KPI (Recommended)

Add a row:

KPI Category: Availability

KPI Name: Storage IO Latency

Metric Name: io_latency

Threshold: p95 latency deviation from baseline

Alert Type: Incident

4. APIM Sheet Recommendations

Incident Alerts

Set Alert Type = Incident for:

API Latency p95

Backend Latency p95

API Error Count

Request Count drop

Capacity Alerts

Set Alert Type = Capacity for:

APIM Capacity

Threshold note:

"Capacity >80% sustained = scale action, not incident"

Add New KPI (Strongly Recommended)

Add a row:

KPI Category: Saturation

KPI Name: Throttled Requests

Metric Name: ThrottledRequests

Threshold: >0 sustained

Alert Type: Incident

5. Azure_Functions Sheet Recommendations

Incident Alerts (Symptoms)

Set Alert Type = Incident for:

Function Failures (5xx)

Failed Requests

Request Count drop

Capacity Alerts (Causes)

Set Alert Type = Capacity for:

Memory Working Set

Scaling Instance Count (approaching max)

Signal Alerts

Set Alert Type = Signal for:

Queue Backlog

Add New KPI (Recommended)

Add a row:

KPI Category: Latency

KPI Name: Execution Duration

Metric Name: ExecutionDuration

Threshold: p95 deviation from baseline

Alert Type: Incident

Reason:

Detects cold start and execution delays

6. ACR Sheet Recommendations

Incident Alerts

Set Alert Type = Incident for:

Pull Failure Rate

Push Failure Rate

Capacity Alerts

Set Alert Type = Capacity for:

Registry CPU Load

Storage Used

Threshold Text Enhancement

For Pull/Push failures, add:

"Validate dependency: Network / Identity / Storage"

7. Why These Changes Matter (Use in Review)

Prevents alert fatigue

Aligns metrics with operational intent

Enables ServiceNow ITOM correlation

Makes automation safe and predictable

Separates symptoms from causes

8. One-Line Executive Explanation

"Alert Type defines whether a metric breach should create an incident, trigger capacity action, or simply be observed — turning monitoring into operationally mature ITOM."
